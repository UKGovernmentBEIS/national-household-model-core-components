    <para>
      This is the changelog for the National Household Model's Scenario
      Language. Each section covers the major changes introduced in a
      particular version of the NHM. The changes are usually under these
      headings:

          <title>Heat loss roofs and ground floors for flats</title>
          <para>
            If a flat has a storey which is the top floor of its
            building, then it has a heat loss roof. Similarly, its
            bottom storey is the bottom floor of its building (in the
            EHS, it is either the basement or ground floor), it will
            have a heat loss floor.

            flats if and only if they have a heat loss roof. The measure
            suitability for

          floors</title>
          <para>
            This has changed from SAP 2009 to SAP 2012. It seems likely
            that the SAP 2009 version was a mistake.
          </para>
          <para>
            In SAP 2009: set Rf to 0.2, then compute
            <literal>Rf + 0.2</literal>.
          </para>
          <para>
            In SAP 2012: compute Rf based on floor insulation thickness,
            then compute <literal>Rf + 0.2</literal>.
          </para>
          <para>
            We now implement the SAP 2012 version.

        <sect4>
          <title>Stock import of solid floors</title>
          <para>
            Version 6.5.0 introduced a bug where Solid floors were being
            reclassified as SuspendedTimber. This is now fixed.

          <title>Infiltrations when resetting walls.</title>
          <para>
            The <emphasis>infiltrations</emphasis> property in
            <xref linkend="ref.action.reset-walls"/> has been broken
            since v6.5.0. It was setting air change rate to 0.
          </para>
          <para>
            This is now working correctly again.
          </para>
        </sect4>
        <sect4>
          <title>Bug in <xref linkend="ref.affected-houses"/></title>
          <para>
            The <xref linkend="ref.affected-houses"/> command would not
            work correctly if used as the source group for a
            <xref linkend="ref.filter"/> in more than one place within
            a single use of the <literal>on.construction</literal>
            command.
          </para>
          <para>
            Each <xref linkend="ref.filter"/> applied would have a
            cumulative effect on the contents of the next use of
            <xref linkend="ref.affected-houses"/>.
          </para>
        </sect4>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Improvements</title>
        <para>
          The manual embedded in the desktop application has had
          additional indexing information added to it, which improves
          the specificity of searches for model commands.
        </para>
        <para>
          In addition, by reading the manual for the help facility, we
          have learned that enclosing search queries in double quotes
          =&quot;like this&quot;= searches for the literal occurrence of
          the text in quotes, rather than the occurrence of all the
          separate words typed in.
        </para>
        <para>
          Taken together these changes mean that when searching for
          model commands like <literal>house.energy-use</literal>,
          entering =&quot;house.energy-use&quot;= into the help will
          produce much better specificity of results.

            Added <xref linkend="ref.house.roof-area"/> to allow you to
            look at the roof area of a dwelling. This is useful when
            installing a solar PV measure.

          <title>Wall Thickness</title>
          <para>
            Wall thickness was not getting set in the stock import. This
            resulted in incorrect u-values for old solid-wall buildings.

      <title>Version 6.5.0</title>
      <para>
        This version of the NHM has been updated to support SAP 2012
        (closely, with the scenario author prevented from putting in
        their own override values) and BREDEM 2012 (more loosely).
      </para>
      <para>
        This changelog primarily covers scenario language changes. For a
        more in-depth discussion of the energy calculator update, see
        ref.sap-2012-spec.

        <title>New Features</title>
        <sect4>
          <title>BREDEM Specific Configuration</title>
          <para>
            The following three actions allow you to change some
            BREDEM-specific features of a house. They have no effect in
            SAP 2012 mode.
          </para>
          <para>
            =ref.action.set-site-exposure= puts a house in an exposure
            category. This maps to a multiplier to its infiltration
            rate.
          </para>
          <para>
            =ref.action.set-interzone-specific-heat-transfer= sets the
            rate of heat transfer from the main living area of the house
            to the rest of the house.
          </para>
          <para>
            =ref.action.reduced-internal-gains= enables reduced internal
            gains for that house. This is supposed to apply to modern
            houses.
          </para>
          <para>
            =ref.action.set-thermal-bridging-factor= is multiplied by
            the external area of the ddwelling to calculate the thermal
            bridging heat loss rate.
          </para>
        </sect4>
        <sect4>
          <title>Switch Energy Calculator Modes</title>
          <para>
            The <xref linkend="ref.scenario"/> element now has an
            <emphasis>energy-calculator:</emphasis> property. This can
            take the values <emphasis>SAP2012</emphasis> or
            <emphasis>BREDEM2012</emphasis>, and determines which rules
            will apply for this scenario.
          </para>
          <para>
            There is a new counterfactual action
            <xref linkend="ref.energy-calculator"/>, which allows you
            to temporarily look at a house in a different energy
            calculator mode.
          </para>
        </sect4>
        <sect4>
          <title>Heat Loss Intermediate Calculations</title>
          <para>
            =ref.house.heat-loss= has now has an optional (unnamed)
            parameter which allows you to look at specific heat-loss due
            to <emphasis>ThermalBridging</emphasis>,
            <emphasis>Infiltration</emphasis> or
            <emphasis>Fabric</emphasis>.
          </para>
          <para>
            If you do not specify this parameter, the behaviour will be
            unchanged from previous releases. You will get the total
            specific heat loss, which is the three terms above added
            together.
          </para>

        <title>Removed Features</title>
        <sect4>
          <title>Solar PV</title>
          <para>
            We have removed <emphasis>roof-coverage</emphasis> and
            <emphasis>efficiency</emphasis> from
            <xref linkend="ref.measure.solar-photovoltaic"/>, and
            replaced them with <emphasis>size</emphasis>, which is the
            peak power rating of the installation measured in kW.
          </para>
        </sect4>
        <sect4>
          <title>Responsiveness</title>
          <para>
            The <literal>scale.responsiveness</literal> action has been
            removed. With hindsight, it was a bad feature, and we do not
            believe it has ever been used.
          </para>
          <para>
            Removed the <emphasis>of:</emphasis> property from
            <xref linkend="ref.house.heating-responsiveness"/>, since
            only the responsiveness of the primary space heating system
            is always relevant.

        <sect4>
          <title>Thermal Mass</title>
          <para>
            The NHM now uses a simplified method for calculating the
            thermal mass of a dwelling.
          </para>
          <para>
            =wall.k-value= has been removed.
          </para>
          <para>
            =ref.action.reset-floors=,
            <xref linkend="ref.action.reset-walls"/> and
            <xref linkend="ref.action.reset-roofs"/> have had their
            <emphasis>k-value</emphasis> and
            <emphasis>party-k-value</emphasis> properties removed.
          </para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Semantic Changes</title>
        <para>
          A number of actions in the NHM are designed for tweaking
          values from SAP tables. In SAP 2012 mode, they will no longer
          have any effect:

            You can now specify multiple stocks in a scenario by
            supplying a list of values to the scenario's
            <literal>stock-id:</literal> argument; for example writing
            <literal>stock-id: [a b c]</literal> will use all the houses
            from stocks <literal>a</literal>, <literal>b</literal>, and
            <literal>c</literal> together. This does not affect old
            scenarios with a single stock, but should make it easier to

            It is now possible to write logical tests in any place where
            you would write a group of houses. The logical test will
            have an &quot;implicit&quot; <xref linkend="ref.filter"/>
            command added to it, so where you would previously have
            written <literal>(filter (X))</literal> you may now write
            just <literal>(X)</literal>. Note that to use
            <literal>filter</literal>'s second argument (a specific set
            to filter, rather than the whole population) you will still
            have to write it out in full.

          <title>Summer Boiler Efficiencies</title>
          <para>
            Changed the default summer boiler efficiency to -10% (10%
            less than the winter efficiency) based on a re-analysis of
            the Product Characteristics Database 2009 (PCDB).

          <para>
            Space heating systems were incorrectly calculating their
            share of the space heating output by comparing their space
            heating fraction to the total hot water fraction (summed
            over all sources of hot water). This bug has now been fixed.

            easily create a template which does the same with other

            when applied to homes with boilers, as they have two

            InSitu calculates an effective efficiency for the heating
            system by taking the amount of heat it supplied and dividing
            it by the amount of fuel it used. This is useful if you want

            was unable to restrict the transactions summed using

            it impossible to sum capital cost transactions, as they are
            tagged <literal>:CAPEX</literal>; behind-the-scenes this was
            caused by the automatic lowercasing of all user-entered

            dates with two dots between them. For example
            <literal>01/01/2014..01/01/2020</literal> is equivalent to
            <literal>(regularly from:01/01/2014 until:01/01/2020)</literal>.
            This also admits the above shorthand, so you can write

            As mentioned in <emphasis>new features</emphasis> above,
            these functions now behave differently if you use them with

            Previously <literal>house.energy-use</literal> and
            <literal>house.emissions</literal> would always return zero,
            and <literal>house.fuel-cost</literal>
            <emphasis>could</emphasis> produce a value, but only for
            strangely defined tariffs. These functions will now compute
            the sum of the values for <literal>PeakElectricity</literal>
            and <literal>OffPeakElectricity</literal> instead.

        <sect4>
          <title>Addition of <xref linkend="ref.house.flags"/> and
          extension of flag matching</title>
          <para>
            The <xref linkend="ref.house.flags"/> element has been
            added, which is useful in reports to output which flags from
            many possibilities are are on a house, rather than producing
            one column for each flag. This was added to make a scenario
            for the CCC easier to analyse.
          </para>
          <para>
            As part of this change, the rules for matching and adjusting
            flags have been extended (in a backwards-compatible way) to
            support more complicated pattern matching. To give some
            examples, you can now use
            <literal>test-flags: [something-*]</literal> to test whether
            a house has a flag starting with
            <literal>something-</literal>, or
            <literal>update-flags: [!something-* something-or-other]</literal>
            to remove all flags starting with
            <literal>something-</literal> and then add a flag
            <literal>something-or-other</literal>. More complicated
            patterns are supported; see the documentation for a flag
            related element for more details.

          <title>Improved performance for loans</title>
          <para>
            The model's performance when simulating many loans should
            now be faster, especially when loans have the
            <literal>tilt:</literal> parameter specified. This work was
            done whilst looking at a scenario which involved a lot of
            loans.

          <title>Change to the handling of build year in stocks</title>
          <para>
            In response to JIRA request EXS-43 the way dwellings are
            created from stocks has been changed so that houses are
            constructed on their build year; this is the very first
            thing that happens in each year.
          </para>
          <para>
            To make this easier to use correctly in a scenario, the
            top-level <xref linkend="ref.on.construction"/> command
            allows you to schedule commands to be run whenever new
            dwellings are constructed.

          <para>
            The <xref linkend="ref.summarize"/> command now allows the
            set to summarize to be specified as the second unnamed
            argument, as well as using named argument
            <literal>group:</literal>. This change was made to improve
            consistency with other set-processing commands. The existing
            syntax remains compatible.

          <title>Change to the handling of build year in stocks</title>
          <para>
            Because cases from the stock now only appear in the
            simulation from the start of their build year onwards, old
            scenarios whose start date was earlier than the build date
            of some cases in a stock may produce different results, as
            previous anachronistic dwellings will no longer be present
            in the simulation. For example, if you were to run a
            scenario with start date 1/1/0000 it would now typically
            have no houses at scenario start.

            <literal>on:simulation</literal> when more than one such
            variable was used in the <literal>preserve:</literal>

          <title>Change to random number generation</title>
          <para>
            Unfortunately the mechanism introduced to support repeatable
            use of random numbers within the
            <xref linkend="ref.scheduling.repeat"/> command in v5.1.4
            also introduced some statistical artifacts in random numbers
            consumed within hypotheses that never become true. For
            example, if you were to use a uniform random number to
            perturb the objective in the <xref linkend="ref.in-order"/>
            command, it would not be as uniform as it should be. In this
            version those artifacts have been fixed, at the expense of
            consistency of randomness between the two versions.

          <title>Stricter validation of <xref linkend="ref.lookup"/>
          and <literal>lookup-table</literal></title>
          <para>
            In previous versions, you could define a
            <xref linkend="ref.lookup"/> or
            <literal>lookup-table</literal> which tried to match
            functions on values they would never produce (for example,
            checking whether a dwelling's region was
            <literal>MainsGas</literal> by mistake). From this version
            onward, the coordinates in lookups and lookup tables are
            validated against the possible values for the associated key
            function.
          </para>
          <para>
            This change was made in response to a mistake in an RHI
            policy scenario where the wrong key function was
            accidentally used, which caused unexpected behaviour in the
            scenario.

          <para>
            <xref linkend="ref.is"/> now produces validation warnings
            if some of the values to match are not possible outputs from
            the function being tested. For example, if you were to write
            <literal>(is house.heating-fuel MiansGas)</literal> (a
            typo), a validation error message will be produced which
            indicates that <literal>MiansGas</literal> is not a possible
            value for <literal>house.heating-fuel</literal>.
          </para>
          <para>
            This change was made because of confusion during the

          <title>Defaults in
          <xref linkend="ref.context.carbon-factors"/></title>
          <para>
            In previous versions of the model, the default carbon
            factors were taken from SAP 2009. If you specified new
            carbon factors using
            <xref linkend="ref.context.carbon-factors"/>, the defaults
            would be entirely replaced. For example, writing
          </para>
          <programlisting language="commonlisp">
  (context.carbon-factors
   (group fuels:PeakElectricity
          carbon-factor: 0.5))
</programlisting>
          <para>
            would set the <literal>PeakElectricity</literal> factor to
            0.5, and all other factors to an implicit zero. This has
            been changed so that the default SAP 2009 carbon factors are
            retained unless a <literal>group</literal> in
            <xref linkend="ref.context.carbon-factors"/> replaces them.

          <para>
            The precision with which energy use and carbon emissions are
            represented has been reduced from a 64-bit IEEE 754 floating
            point number to a 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point number.
            This should not have any practical impact, but it will
            produce very small changes in the values produced by
            existing scenarios for these quantities, and marginally
            reduce the precision with which they can be represented.
            However, the loss of precision will be far from the decimal
            point.

          <title>Hybrid Heat Pumps and Gas Heat Pumps</title>
          <para>
            The model's representation of heat pumps has been changed to
            allow non-electric heat pumps and hybrid heat pumps to be
            represented. Existing heat pumps in scenarios will still
            default to electricity, as these changes only take effect
            when the new parameters to
            <xref linkend="ref.measure.heat-pump"/> are supplied.
          </para>

            The treatment of non-electric heat pumps is identical to
            electric heat pumps, except the fuel consumed is all of one
            sort (rather than being peak / off-peak). The
            <literal>fuel:</literal> argument to

            When a hybrid heat pump is installed, all hot water is

            each month of the year, space heat is produced according to
            the hybrid ratio for that month (if the hybrid ratio is 1,
            all space heat is produced from the hybrid fuel at the
            hybrid efficiency; if 0, the space heat is produced using
            the heat pump as normal).

            <emphasis>Users should note</emphasis> that this approach
            suffers from the same problems as using an average seasonal
            performance factor for a heat pump, but with some additional
            complications. The performance of a heat pump is determined
            by a (typically asymmetric, nonlinear) function of the
            circulating temperature and the heat store temperature.
            These two values are in turn functions of exterior
            temperature, emitter performance, the dwelling's heat loss,
            and thermostat settings. A choice of SPF, and equally of the
            monthly hybrid ratios, implies a choice of distribution over
            all of these factors which can then be used to produce an
            average performance; such an average performance will by
            systematically biased when the distribution over one of the
            factors changes (for example when considering the
            geographical relationship to climate). In addition, because
            a hybrid heat pump is likely to select fuel based on
            <emphasis>economic</emphasis> considerations, the hybrid
            ratios also imply an additional choice of relationship
            between the costs of different fuels.

            that the quality of the actions must be independent). This

            However, unlike the old NPV, you can modify the function to
            be predicted (so it can be a restricted subset of costs, or
            something which is not a cost), you can change the
            discounting rule to be anything you would like (for example,
            <xref linkend="ref.hyberbolic-discount"/> has also been
            added), and you can control which time-sensitive aspects of
            the calculation should or should not be predictable.

              using a random number within one hypothetical condition
              does not affect the random numbers produced in other
              hypothetical conditions. This means that, for example,
              when the repeat action repeats a use of the

            A new element <xref linkend="ref.scheduling.repeat"/> has

            <literal>on.dates</literal> to repeat the execution of

          <para>
            In addition, the repeat element can be configured to re-try
            its actions from scratch, preserving only the side-effects
            on a user-defined list of variables, allowing for a very
            limited kind of optimisation. For example, you can
            repeatedly attempt the offering of a subsidised measure with
            a non-linear takup against subsidy level, preserving only
            changes to the level, until sufficiently many measures are
            taken up.

          <title>Stricter validation of insulation measures</title>

            All the insulation measures have been modified so that they
            <emphasis>require</emphasis> a value for the
            <literal>thickness:</literal> argument. In previous
            versions, it was legal to write the measures without a
            thickness, but the default value for the thickness,
            resistance and u-value are all zero. The way that the model
            keeps track of the presence of insulation is through a
            change to the thickness, so a measure without a thickness
            would not affect the insulated status of the wall, as far as
            the model is concerned.
          </para>
          <para>
            Since this caused some understandably confusing results, a
            validation rule has been added requiring the thickness to be

            The <xref linkend="ref.interpolate"/> function has been

            is also possible using the <literal>lookup-table</literal>
            macro, but a direct use of interpolate may be easier to read
            and write, and can extrapolate beyond the ends of the

          <title>Change to definition of NPV</title>
          <para>
            <xref linkend="ref.npv"/> has been redefined so that the
            <literal>discount:</literal> argument is used to discount
            future costs according to a annual geometric progression
            whose multiplier is 1/(1+rate). Previously, the discount
            argument discounted costs according to an annual geometric
            progression with a multiplier of (1-rate).
          </para>
          <para>
            This makes the discount rate for NPV analogous to the

            which can be used within the dwelling, and a new fuel type
            has been introduced to allow the price for exported

          <title>Addition of random number state to sequence
          report</title>
          <para>
            The sequence report now has an additional column which gives
            the random number generator's internal state after each
            event is processed. This is only useful for determining at
            what point the random behaviour in two different runs has
            diverged.

          <title>Improvements to include and ~module</title>
          <para>
            To help with the creation of reusable modules, a new include
            elemnt has been added, <literal>include-modules</literal>,
            which <emphasis>only</emphasis> includes modules or other
            <literal>include-modules</literal> statements in the top
            level of the referenced scenario. In addition to this, it is
            now legal to define a module twice; only the first
            definition has any effect.
          </para>
          <para>
            The upshot of this is that if you have modules which depend
            on each other, you no longer need to make sure you only
            include each of these dependencies once.
          </para>
          <para>
            In addition, local names within a module can now be written
            directly by prefacing them with a slash; for example, the
            following
          </para>
          <programlisting language="commonlisp">
    (~module M
          (template T [] /my-identifier))
</programlisting>
          <para>
            is equivalent to
          </para>
          <programlisting language="commonlisp">
    (template M/T [] M/my-identifier)
</programlisting>
          <para>
            This special handling also applies to names starting with
            <literal>#/</literal> or <literal>!/</literal>, in which
            cases the module name is inserted before the slash, but
            after the punctuation.

          <title>In-scenario assertions added</title>
          <para>
            To make it easier to check scenarios are working as
            intended, the <xref linkend="ref.assert"/> element has been
            added to the language. This can be used within any of the
            scheduling elements (like <literal>on.dates</literal>), to
            test that a given condition holds at a certain point in the
            scenario, either for every house in a particular set, or for
            the simulation as a whole. Assertions can be configured to
            produce a warning, or to stop the simulation from running if
            they fail.

          <title>house.insolation element added</title>
          <para>
            <xref linkend="ref.house.insolation"/> is a new element
            which lets you determine the average amount of insolation on
            an inclined plane under current weather conditions for the
            house, in kWh/year.
          </para>

          <para>
            In previous versions of the NHM, references to previously
            defined variables, actions, tests and so on had to be
            preceded with a <literal>#</literal> symbol. It is now
            possible simply to use the name, without a
            <literal>#</literal> symbol, although the old syntax is
            still supported.

            Most values which are computed at runtime are now
            bounds-checked, and warnings will be generated if they are
            not sensible. Checked values include heating system
            efficiencies, sizes, capex, opex, and hot water tank sizes;
            for example, if a measure's pricing function produces a
            negative price, a warning will be generated and the price
            will be clamped to zero.

            The top-level scenario element now has an argument
            <literal>profile-depth:</literal> which can be used to
            profile the running of your scenarios; if it is set to a
            positive number, an additional report will be generated
            showing how long different parts of the scenario are taking
            to run.

            for computing those values. This makes it a more efficient
            alternative to repeated use of the <literal>under</literal>
            function, for example in the case where disaggregated fuel
            use is required under some complex set of counterfactual

            An oversight in the stock import code which meant that only

            a loft has been corrected; the EHS variable
            <literal>FLITYPES</literal> in the
            <literal>services</literal> file is now used to determine
            the presence of a loft. This increases the number of

          <para>
            A fault in the energy calculator has been corrected.
            Previously, the SAP adjustment which increases household
            ventilation in low-ventilation buildings was applied
            <emphasis>before</emphasis> the SAP adjustment which takes
            account of local wind speed when calculating the air change
            rate for a house. This caused a small excess increase in air
            change rate for those houses in which the structural air
            change rate was below 1, but the effect of local exposure
            would have raised it above one. The adjustments are now
            applied in the correct order (exposure effects first,
            occupants' adjustment second).
          </para>
          <para>
            The effect of the correction is small; under SAP 2012
            assumptions, for the EHS 2012 stock, the mean energy use has
            decreased from 22772.73 kWh/year to 22753.2 kWh/year. The
            maximum has been reduced from 323656 to 323616, and the

        the stock. This will allow you to define expectations for new
        build, without having to find analogous existing houses and copy
        them.
