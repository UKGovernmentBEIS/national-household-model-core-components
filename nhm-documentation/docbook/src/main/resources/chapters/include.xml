		Includes are a way to split scenarios across many files. 
		They are especially helpful for re-using parts which are common to many scenarios.

	  To include into a scenario you can use the special
	  <code>include</code> language element; You can include a
	  scenario using its id by writing <code>(include id:ID_GOES_HERE)</code>, 
	  or using its name and version stamp by writing 
	  <code>(include name:my-scenario version:1)</code>.

	  To get a version stamp to go with a scenario, find the version
	  you want to include in the interface and click the green shape
	  next to the name field. This will generate a number which
	  together with the name uniquely identifies that scenario
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  Includes work a bit like templates, in that the
	  <code>include</code> expression is replaced by all the contents
	  of the included file; inclusion takes place before template
	  expansion, so you can include a file of templates and use them
	  in another file. This does mean that you cannot give two
	  templates the same name if you include them into the same
	  scenario, and that if you define a template with an include in
	  its template body, the include will be filled out before the
	  template is expanded, so you can't substitute a template
	  parameter into the include's arguments.
