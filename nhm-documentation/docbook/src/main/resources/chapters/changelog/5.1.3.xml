      <title>Improvement of <code>interpolate</code></title>
      <para>
        The <xref linkend="ref.interpolate"/> function has been improved to support
        linear interpolation into an arbitrary piecewise curve; instead of interpolating
        between two points, you can now specify as many points as you like. This is also
        possible using the <code>lookup-table</code> macro, but a direct use of
        interpolate may be easier to read and write, and can extrapolate beyond the ends
        of the function if desired.
      </para>
      <para>
        This is intended to be useful for specifying pricing or sizing functions derived
        from real data.

      <title>Improvement of <code>finance.with-loan</code></title>
      <para>
        <xref linkend="ref.finance.with-loan" /> has been improved so that the
        <code>term:</code>, <code>rate:</code> and <code>tilt:</code> arguments can all be
        specified using run-time functions rather than fixed constants.
      </para>

    <section>
      <title>Change to definition of NPV</title>
      <para>
        <xref linkend="ref.npv" /> has been redefined so that the
        <code>discount:</code> argument is used to discount future costs according to a
        annual geometric progression whose multiplier is 1/(1+rate). Previously, the
        discount argument discounted costs according to an annual geometric progression
        with a multiplier of (1-rate).
      </para>
      <para>
        This makes the discount rate for NPV analogous to the current rate of interest,
        rather than the degree of depreciation of uninvested capital as it was before.
