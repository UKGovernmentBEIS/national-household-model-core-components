## Tests 2 things:

result <- load.probe("result")

## TODO: both SAP rows should be the same (context.energy-constants has no effect)

## TODO: both BREDEM rows are different by the expected amount (context.energy-constants has an effect)

## TODO: the SAP and BREDEM rows with the default values are different by the expected amount when using their default values
